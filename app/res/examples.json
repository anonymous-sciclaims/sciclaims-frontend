People who are infected of COVID-19 but do not show symptoms can also spread the virus to others. We are still learning about how the virus spreads and the severity of illness it causes. \n\nCOVID-19 spreads very easily from person to person. How easily coronavirus spreads from person to person can vary. The virus that causes COVID-19 appears to spread more efficiently than influenza but not as efficiently as measles, which is among the most contagious viruses known to affect people.\n\nCOVID-19 most commonly spreads during close contact. People who are physically near (within 6 feet) a person with COVID-19 or have direct contact with that person are at greatest risk of infection. When people with COVID-19 cough, sneeze, sing, talk, or breathe they produce respiratory droplets. These droplets can range in size from larger droplets (some of which are visible) to smaller droplets. Small droplets can also form particles when they dry very quickly in the airstream. Infections occur mainly through exposure to respiratory droplets when a person is in close contact with someone who has COVID-19. Respiratory droplets cause infection when they are inhaled or deposited on mucous membranes, such as those that line the inside of the nose and mouth. As the respiratory droplets travel further from the person with COVID-19, the concentration of these droplets decreases. Larger droplets fall out of the air due to gravity. Smaller droplets and particles spread apart in the air. With passing time, the amount of infectious virus in respiratory droplets also decreases.\n\nCOVID-19 can sometimes be spread by airborne transmission. Some infections can be spread by exposure to virus in small droplets and particles that can linger in the air for minutes to hours. These viruses may be able to infect people who are further than 6 feet away from the person who is infected or after that person has left the space. This kind of spread is referred to as airborne transmission and is an important way that infections like tuberculosis, measles, and chicken pox are spread. There is evidence that under certain conditions, people with COVID-19 seem to have infected others who were more than 6 feet away. These transmissions occurred within enclosed spaces that had inadequate ventilation."

The study confirms that diabetes significantly increases coronavirus sufferers' risk of dying. Almost one in three of all deaths from coronavirus among people in hospital in England during the pandemic have been associated with diabetes, according to the study. People with type 1 diabetes - the autoimmune form of the disease - are three-and-a-half times more likely to die if they catch Covid-19 than non-diabetics, while type 2 diabetics - those with the form closely linked to being overweight - are twice as likely to die as non-diabetics. Nine out of 10 diabetics have type 2, and many are obese.\n\nAge, however, is the biggest determining risk factor for death among those with either form of diabetes who get Covid-19. Under-40s have a very low risk compared with those over 40, and especially compared with older people, according to new findings collated by NHS England. People with type 1 diabetes, which is usually diagnosed in childhood, tend to be younger than those with type 2. Last week, separate findings suggested that a quarter of coronavirus-related deaths were among people with diabetes. The findings have not yet been subjected to peer review but will soon be published in a leading medical journal. This undated electron microscope image made available by the US National Institutes of Health in February 2020 shows the coronavirus that causes COVID-19. So far during the pandemic, 7,466 people who died in hospital in England had type 2 diabetes and 365 had type 1. Prof Jonathan Valabhji, NHS England's national clinical director for diabetes and obesity and the study's lead author, said: 'This research shows the extent of the risk of coronavirus for people with diabetes and the different risks for those with type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Importantly, it also shows that higher blood glucose levels and obesity further increase the risk in both types of diabetes.'

In contrast, systematic reviews and meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials have failed to show any positive association between physical activity and cognitive improvement.

You might then potentially infect yourself by touching your face, which happens more often than you think.\n\nSo how long can SARS-CoV-2 survive on a non-living surface? Under the carefully-controlled conditions inside a laboratory, an early study found that it remains stable on metals and plastic for three days. Outside a lab, however, the virus might last considerably longer: its genetic material could be detected on surfaces 17 days after a cruise ship was empty of passengers (although it's not clear whether that material represents infectious virus particles).\n\nTo answer both questions, we turn to a recent systematic review of the scientific literature published in the Journal of Hospital Infection, led by Gunter Kampf of the Institute of Hygiene and Environmental Medicine in Germany. The review involved scouring a database for studies that had examined how long coronaviruses can persist on surfaces and/or the effect of disinfectants. The search returned 22 results."

In our analysis we found that PTENP1 positively regulates PTEN levels. Furthermore, we found that the PTENP1 locus undergoes CN losses in human cancer and this correlates with decrease in PTEN; thus we propose that PTENP1 is a bona fide tumour suppressor gene. In light of this, better tools must be developed to detect pseudogene abundance in cancer. For instance, pseudogenes including PTENP1 have been overlooked to such an extent that pseudogene-specific probes are absent in some microarray platforms (Supplementary Figure 7b)."

Meanwhile, cancer stem cells are believed to contribute to tumorigenesis and metastasis. Our earlier studies in cell lines and animal models revealed that CSCs were enriched in TNBC patients. In addition, CSCs sorted from TNBC cell lines were more tumorigenic relative to non-CSCs.[3,4] In the present study, we further analyzed the relationship between CSCs and cancer development in TNBC patients using ALDH1 as a CSC marker. Since the first report by Ginestier et al[11] showing that ALDH1 expression was associated with poor clinical outcome in breast cancer, several studies have indicated that ALDH1+ breast cancer cells are related to TNBC."

In this study, we report the design, preclinical development, immunogenicity and anti-viral protective effect in rhesus macaques of the BNT162b2 vaccine candidate. BNT162b2 contains an LNP-formulated nucleoside-modified mRNA that encodes the spike glycoprotein captured in its prefusion conformation. After expression of the BNT162b2 coding sequence in cells, approximately 20% of the spike molecules are in the one-RBD 'up', two-RBD 'down' state. Immunisation of mice with a single dose of BNT162b2 induced dose level-dependent increases in pseudovirus neutralisation titers. Prime-boost vaccination of rhesus macaques elicited authentic SARS-CoV-2 neutralising geometric mean titers 10.2 to 18.0 times that of a SARS-CoV-2 convalescent human serum panel. BNT162b2 generated strong TH1 type CD4+ and IFNy+ CD8+ T-cell responses in mice and rhesus macaques."

		"text": "Chenodeoxycholic acid attenuates high-fat diet-induced obesity and hyperglycemia via the G protein-coupled bile acid receptor 1 and proliferator-activated receptor Î³ pathway.\n\nTGR5 is a membrane receptor that mediates bile acid signaling. In a previous study by the current authors, it was reported that TGR5 regulates glucose and energy metabolism and is therefore a candidate to combat obesity (32). Ligand binding to TGR5 induces adenylate cyclase, leading to an increase in intracellular cAMP (23). Elevated levels of cAMP activate PKA, which phosphorylates the CREB transcription factor, transactivating its target genes by binding to cAMP response elements within their promoter sequences (23). In BAT, D2 expression is promoted, boosting the local production of thyroid hormone and consequently increasing energy expenditure (23). Several other genes involved in the regulation of energy expenditure are upregulated following ligand binding by bile acids in WAT and BAT, as demonstrated in the current study and a previous report (23). In the current study, the mRNA levels of fatty acid synthesis and oxidation-related factors were increased in BAT but not in WAT. This increase in energy expenditure and acceleration of metabolism in response to TGR5 activation leads to decreased body weight via the suppression of fat deposition."

		"text": "Developing a Vaccine to Block West Nile Virus Transmission: In Silico Studies, Molecular Characterization, Expression, and Blocking Activity of Culex pipiens mosGCTL-1.\n\nMosquito galactose-specific C-type lectins (mosGCTLs), such as mosGCTL-1, act as ligands to facilitate the invasion of flaviviruses like West Nile virus (WNV). WNV interacts with the mosGCTL-1 of Aedes aegypti (Culicidae) and facilitates the invasion of this virus. Nevertheless, there is no data about the role of mosGCTL-1 as a transmission-blocking vaccine candidate in Culex pipiens, the most abundant Culicinae mosquito in temperate regions. Methods: Adult female Cx. pipiens mosquitoes were experimentally infected with a WNV infectious blood meal, and the effect of rabbit anti-rmosGCTL-1 antibodies on virus replication was evaluated. Additionally, in silico studies such as the prediction of protein structure, homology modeling, and molecular interactions were carried out. Results: We showed a 30% blocking activity of Cx. pipiens mosGCTL-1 polyclonal antibodies (compared to the 10% in the control group) with a decrease in infection rates in mosquitoes at day 5 post-infection, suggesting that there may be other proteins in the midgut of Cx. pipiens that could act as cooperative-receptors for WNV. In addition, docking results revealed that WNV binds with high affinity, to the Culex mosquito lectin receptors. Conclusions: Our results do not support the idea that mosGCTL-1 of Cx. pipiens primarily interacts with WNV to promote viral infection, suggesting that other mosGCTLs may act as primary infection factors in Cx. pipiens."

The current gold standard for COVID-19 diagnosis is real-time RT-PCR detection of SARS-CoV-2 from nasopharyngeal swabs. Low sensitivity, exposure risks to healthcare workers, and global shortages of swabs and personal protective equipment, however, necessitate the validation of new diagnostic approaches. Saliva is a promising candidate for SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics because (1) collection is minimally invasive and can reliably be self-administered and (2) saliva has exhibited comparable sensitivity to nasopharyngeal swabs in detection of other respiratory pathogens, including endemic human coronaviruses, in previous studies. To validate the use of saliva for SARS-CoV-2 detection, we tested nasopharyngeal and saliva samples from confirmed COVID-19 patients and self-collected samples from healthcare workers on COVID-19 wards. When we compared SARS-CoV-2 detection from patient-matched nasopharyngeal and saliva samples, we found that saliva yielded greater detection sensitivity and consistency throughout the course of infection. Furthermore, we report less variability in self-sample collection of saliva for COVID-19 cases. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that saliva is a viable and more sensitive alternative to nasopharyngeal swabs and could enable at-home self-administered sample collection for accurate large-scale SARS-CoV-2 testing."
